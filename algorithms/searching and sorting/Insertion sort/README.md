# Insertion Sort

## What is Insertion Sort?
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## What is the algorithm for bubble sort?
Let's consider that we want to sort some elements in an array in ascending order.
- Step 1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. 
- Step 2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. 
- Step 3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

## Features of bubble sort
- It is efficient for smaller data sets, but very inefficient for larger lists.
- Its space complexity is less.
