# Merge Sort

## What is merge sort? 
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and conquer strategy. It works by recursively dividing the array into two equal halves, then sort them and combine them. 
It takes a time of (n logn) in the worst case.

## Features of binary search
-Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists.
-Merge Sort is a stable sort which means that the same element in an array maintain their original positions with respect to each other.
-Overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). It is more efficient as it is in worst case also the runtime is O(nlogn)
-The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.
