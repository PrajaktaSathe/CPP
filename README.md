## What does this repository contain?
This repository features programs in C++. It is divided into 3 folders (data structures, algorithms, and other programs) in which you can find code implementations in C++, along with an explanation of the concept.

## Can I contribute?
Yes! :smile: you can definitely contribute!
The following are some of the things you can do - 
1. If you have a program written in C++ that is not in the repository you can open up a PR. You can also open up a PR if you have another way of implementing a concept in the repo.
2. Also, if you can see something wrong (maybe like an error or something), you can open up a PR.
3. Another suggestion is if you can think of a creative way to explain any concept using markdown, you are welcome to contribute!
